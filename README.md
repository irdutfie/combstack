# combstack
A Combinator based development stack

Elimenate the Von Neumann architecture bottleneck between CPU and main memory.


$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi
$$


## Introduction ##

## Background ##

## Motivation ##

This is a search down the path of computation that wasn't taken.  "I would rather have today's algorithms.." is an inspiration to look
again at Combinators again to see if they're fundamental nature can be combined with modern hardware acceleration techniques.

The question is if I can apply a current algorithm to vintage hardware designs, even ones that were only conceptualised, and still go fast?

Can I apply roads of computation not taken because of a lack of methods available at the time but later on have become available but haven't been re-applied?

Can I go so minimal in the implementation that the design looks like that of a simple puzzle or toy system?

How do I make a minimal implementation that provide maximal functionality?
